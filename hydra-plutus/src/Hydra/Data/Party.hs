-- | On-chain representation of a Hydra party.

-- NOTE: This roughly corresponds to the 'Party' in 'hydra-node', but is
-- simplified to allow usage of this type in plutus-tx. If we would use the
-- complex type directly, which is based on 'cardano-crypto-class', we would get
-- errors like "Error: Unsupported feature: Kind: GHC.Types.Nat".
--
-- The data constructor should not be used to construct this value as it would
-- always come from off-chain code via 'partyFromVerificationKeyBytes'.
