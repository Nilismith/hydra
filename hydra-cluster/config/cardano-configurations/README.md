# Cardano Configurations

> [!WARNING]
> This directory contains configuration files for all public Cardano
> networks live at the date of this writing (2023-10-26). It's been
> copied verbatim from the
> [cardano-configurations](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-configurations)
> repository as it was previously included as a [Git
> submodule](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules)
> which does not play well with
> [foliage](https://github.com/input-output-hk/foliage/issues/88)
> therefore preventing us from publishing Hydra packages to
> [CHaP](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-haskell-packages).

> [!NOTE]
> TODO: Remove those files and pull canonical configuration files from wherever they live on-line, currently [The Cardano Operations Book](https://book.world.dev.cardano.org/environments.html).
